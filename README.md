# C Language Learning Repository

Welcome to my C programming learning repository! This repository contains various C programs I've written while learning the fundamentals of C programming.

## 📁 Programs Included

### Number Pattern Program
**File:** `number pattern.c`

A simple program that prints a triangular number pattern.

**Output:**
```
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
```
